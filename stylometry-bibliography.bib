  abstract = {In this report we show how the class of adaptive prediction methods that Sutton called \&quot;temporal difference,\&quot; or TD, methods are related to the theory of squential decision making. TD methods have been used as \&quot;adaptive critics\&quot; in connectionist learning systems, and have been proposed as models of animal learning in classical conditioning experiments. Here we relate TD methods to decision tasks formulated in terms of a stochastic dynamical system whose behavior unfolds over time under the influence of a decision maker\&apos;s actions. Strategies are sought for selecting actions so as to maximize a measure of long-term payoff gain. Mathematically, tasks such as this can be formulated as Markovian decision problems, and numerous methods have been proposed for learning how to solve such problems. We show how a TD method can be understood as a novel synthesis of concepts from the theory of stochastic dynamic programming, which comprises the standard method for solving such tasks when a model of...},

  abstract = {The uses in ecology of the terms richness, diversity, homogeneity, and similarity are considered in the context of recent studies of plant and animal communities. Various uses of divesity are reviewed and an index of diversity derived from the distance measure of similarity is suggested. This index is ?i=1n2i where S equals the number of species and n equals the number of individuals in each species. This index is compared with other indices of diversity. The principal problem of measuring diversity is the assessment of the homogeneity or similarity of the sample or samples being studied. An advantage of the proposed index is that it derives from a measure of similarity of which it is a special case, and it is a special case, and it is a more natural and familiar representation of points in a coordinate system.

  abstract = {Hurricane Katrina continues to capture attention and influence scholarship including official reports that focus more on event chronologies than on conceptual patterns. Our paper explores conceptual patterns crisis management behaviour, drawing upon Lalonde's (2004) archetypes of crisis managers as collectivists, integrators, and reactives. We add a paralytics archetype for our analysis. Key findings include an imbalance between counterproductive and constructive archetypes. Reactive and paralytic crisis manager behaviours were over-represented, significantly contributing to conflict, communication failures, and the systemic failure of governments. Collectivist and integrator archetypes were badly under-represented, limiting intergovernmental relations, cooperation, and communication embedded in these behaviour types. Crisis management performance with future crises would benefit from a systematic assessment of crisis management styles and behaviours. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {The lexical diversity of children with specific language impairment (SLI) (ages 3 years 7 months to 7 years 3 months) was compared to that of normally developing same-age peers and younger normally developing children matched according to mean length of utterance in words (MLUw). Lexical diversity was calculated from spontaneous speech samples using D, a measure that uses repeated calculations of type-token ratio (TTR) to estimate how TTR changes as the speech samples increase in size. When D computations were based on 250-word samples, developmental differences were apparent. For both children with SLI and typically developing children, older subgroups showed higher D scores than younger subgroups, and subgroups with higher MLUws showed higher D scores than subgroups with lower MLUws. Children with SU did not differ from same-age peers. At lower MLUw levels, children with SLI showed higher D scores than younger typically developing children matched for MLUw. The developmental sensitivity of D notwithstanding, comparisons using 100-utterance samples, in which the number of lexical tokens varied as a function of the children's MLUws, and comparisons between 250- and 500-word samples revealed the possible influence of sample size on this measure. However, analysis of the effect sizes using smaller and larger samples revealed that D is not affected by sample size to the degree seen for more traditional measures of lexical diversity.},

A typology of bilinguals is proposed based on these measures of lexical richness, and the validity of the typology is then investigated in an empirical study among two groups of bilingual informants with different language dominance profiles (25 Dutch\dbend{}French bilinguals from Brussels and 24 French\dbend{}English bilinguals from Paris). The most important advantage of the proposed operationalization is that it allows researchers carry out precise measurements of bilingual ability in languages or language varieties for which no standardized tests exist and that these measures can be calculated on oral data that have been collected in an informal and unobtrusive way, in a naturalistic setting.},

  doi = {10.1093/llc/fqt031},
  abstract = {Much research in translation studies indicates that translated texts are ontologically different from original non-translated ones. Translated texts, in any language, can be considered a dialect of that language, known as \dbend{}translationese\dbend. Several characteristics of translationese have been proposed as universal in a series of hypotheses. In this work, we test these hypotheses using a computational methodology that is based on supervised machine learning. We define several classifiers that implement various linguistically informed features, and assess the degree to which different sets of features can distinguish between translated and original texts. We demonstrate that some feature sets are indeed good indicators of translationese, thereby corroborating some hypotheses, whereas others perform much worse (sometimes at chance level), indicating that some \dbend{}universal\dbend{} assumptions have to be reconsidered.In memoriam: Miriam Shlesinger, 1947\dbend{}2012},

It summarizes and evaluates over forty essays, giving details on works discussed, sample sizes used, statistical methods applied, and quotations from the researchers. The essay ends with a polemical summary of what has been done and what the future holds. It emphasizes the importance of extended pre-computational stages of learning about language and discourse analysis; reading previous research, building on and challenging theory; and the use of carefully crafted, small databases to test specific questions.},

All four methods were implemented in a system and tested on an annotated subset of the Treebank corpus consisting of 2026 pronouns.

For this reason, semantic information addition is necessary for the definition of new NLP strategies. In this paper, a method oriented to pronominal anaphora resolution in Spanish is presented. This method is based on two ontologies, On and Ov, that define semantic concept branches for nouns and verbs respectively. Also, the method uses two relation sets in order to solve the anaphora. These sets are formed by semantic patterns that define the compatibility between a subject and its verb and verb and its complement, using the ontological concepts of their heads. The semantic behaviour provided by these patterns allows the identification of the noun phrase antecedents of a Spanish personal pronoun. This antecedent has the best compatibility ratio among all proposed antecedents of the anaphoric pronoun. This compatibility ratio is measured using the relation level between concepts in the ontological branch of each pair member.},

Hearst has already tackled this problem with good results (Hearst, 1994). One of her main assumptions is that a change in subject is accompanied by a change in vocabulary. Using this assumption, but by introducing a new measure of word significance, we have been able to build a robust and reliable algorithm which exhibits improved accuracy without sacrificing language independency. 1 Introduction Automatic detection of subject divisions within a text is considered to be a very difficult task even for humans, let alone machines. But such subject divisions are used in more complex tasks in text processing such as text summarisation. An automatic method for marking subject boundaries is highly desirable. Hearst (Hearst, 1994) addresses this problem by applying a statistical method for detecting subjects within text. Hearst describes an algorithm for what she calls...},

The design of this module was motivated by the observation that, although there exist many theories of anaphora resolution, no one of these theories is complete. Thus we have implemented a blackboard-like architecture in which individual partial theories can be encoded as separate modules that can interact to propose candidate antecedents and to evaluate each other's proposals.},

In addition some authors influence other authors' interests. In this work, we propose to model the influence of cited authors along with the interests of citing authors. Moreover, we hypothesize that apart from the citations present in documents, the context surrounding the citation mention provides extra topical information about the cited authors. However, associating terms in the context to the cited authors remains an open problem. We propose novel document generation schemes that incorporate the context while simultaneously modeling the interests of citing authors and influence of the cited authors. Our experiments show significant improvements over baseline models for various evaluation criteria such as link prediction between document and cited author, and quantitatively explaining unseen text.},

The first corpus is composed of long texts written by professional authors, while the second corpus is formed by short texts written by students. In both corpora, different text genres are included. Thus, the objective of this study is to analyze several stylometric variables to test its capacity as markers for authorship attribution when the corpora vary in size and text genre. We represent the texts as high dimensional vectors and we visualize the similarities between them using multidimensional scaling. We conclude that the length of texts is a factor that affects the discriminatory capacity of the stylometric variables. We also found that there are certain variables that are better than others to identify specific authors and specific text genres.},

  abstract = {In the literary world, authorship of great novels
is like writing a great piece of music; while
there may never be a perfect way to determine
if someone wrote a particular work or not,
equations and algorithms have been developed
in information theory and statistics to help
those trying to discover the true authorship of
contested written works. Because no method is
perfect, using a set of methods on the same
works can be used to give high probabilities
of authorship. The JGAAP system houses
a collection of methods such as Histogram
Distance and Manhattan Distance and event sets
such as word bigrams and character trigrams
to allow users to perform multiple tests on
contested works to see if the supposed author is
actually the author by comparing samples from
both the contested author and other possible
authors.
We apply this framework and show a notable
discontinuity in the authorial style of the novel
El Ingenioso Hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha,
better known as Don Quijote (or Don Quixote).},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical generative model, named author-genre-topic model (AGTM), to perform satellite image annotation. Different from the existing author-topic model in which each author and topic are associated with the multinomial distributions over topics and words, in AGTM, each genre, author, and topic are associated with the multinomial distributions over authors, topics, and words, respectively. The bias of the distribution of the authors with respect to the topics can be rectified by incorporating the distribution of the genres with respect to the authors. Therefore, the classification accuracy of documents is improved when the information of genre is introduced. By representing the images with several visual words, the AGTM can be used for satellite image annotation. The labels of classes and scenes of the images correspond to the authors and the genres of the documents, respectively. The labels of classes and scenes of test images can be estimated, and the accuracy of satellite image annotation is improved when the information of scenes is introduced in the training images. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {One of the major applications of data mining is in helping companies determine which potential customers to market to. If the expected pro t from a customer is greater than the cost of marketing to her, the marketing action for that customer is executed. So far, work in this area has considered only the intrinsic value of the customer (i.e, the expected pro t from sales to her). We propose to model also the customer's network value: the expected pro t from sales to other customers she may inuence to buy, the customers those may inuence, and so on recursively. Instead of viewing a market as a set of independent entities, we view it as a social network and model it as a Markov random eld. We show the advantages of this approach using a social network mined from a collaborative ltering database. Marketing that exploits the network value of customers|also known as viral marketing|can be extremely eective, but is still a black art. Our work can be viewed as a step towards providing a more solid foundation for it, taking advantage of the availability of large relevant databases.

  doi = {10.1145/2086737.2086740},
  abstract = {Topic modeling has become a popular method used for data analysis in various domains including text documents. Previous topic model approaches, such as probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), have shown impressive success in discovering low-rank hidden structures for modeling text documents. These approaches, however do not take into account the manifold structure of the data, which is generally informative for nonlinear dimensionality reduction mapping. More recent topic model approaches, Laplacian PLSI (LapPLSI) and Locally-consistent Topic Model (LTM), have incorporated the local manifold structure into topic models and have shown resulting benefits. But they fall short of achieving full discriminating power of manifold learning as they only enhance the proximity between the low-rank representations of neighboring pairs without any consideration for non-neighboring pairs. In this article, we propose a new approach, Discriminative Topic Model (DTM), which separates non-neighboring pairs from each other in addition to bringing neighboring pairs closer together, thereby preserving the global manifold structure as well as improving local consistency. We also present a novel model-fitting algorithm based on the generalized EM algorithm and the concept of Pareto improvement. We empirically demonstrate the success of DTM in terms of unsupervised clustering and semisupervised classification accuracies on text corpora and robustness to parameters compared to state-of-the-art techniques.},

We present a new learning-based method for adducing the "depth of difference" between two example sets and offer evidence that this method solves the authorship verification problem with very high accuracy. The underlying idea is to test the rate of degradation of the accuracy of learned models as the best features are iteratively dropped from the learning process.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we shed new light on the authenticity of the Corpus Caesarianum, a group of five commentaries describing the campaigns of Julius Caesar (100\textendash{}44 BC), the founder of the Roman empire. While Caesar himself has authored at least part of these commentaries, the authorship of the rest of the texts remains a puzzle that has persisted for nineteen centuries. In particular, the role of Caesar's general Aulus Hirtius, who has claimed a role in shaping the corpus, has remained in contention. Determining the authorship of documents is an increasingly important authentication problem in information and computer science, with valuable applications, ranging from the domain of art history to counter-terrorism research. We describe two state-of-the-art authorship verification systems and benchmark them on 6 present-day evaluation corpora, as well as a Latin benchmark dataset. Regarding Caesar's writings, our analyses allow us to establish that Hirtius's claims to part of the corpus must be considered legitimate. We thus demonstrate how computational methods constitute a valuable methodological complement to traditional, expert-based approaches to document authentication.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the 2001, Volume 8, Number 3, issue of the Journal of Quantitative Linguistics (pp. 213 \textendash{} 231) M. M. Dominique and Cyril Labb{\'e} published a paper entitled ``Inter-Textual Distance and Authorship Attribution. Corneille and Moli{\`e}re''. Dominique and Cyril Labb{\'e} (hereafter referred to as DCL) propose a new formula for the computation of dissimilarity between texts, as well as a distances scale. They intend to apply it in the field of authorship attribution, and especially in one particular case: a controversy about the authorship of several plays signed by Moli{\`e}re. The object of this paper is to discuss their rationale and conclusions in the light of several simple experiments. Though we will quote DCL's paper throughout, some previous knowledge of its content is recommended. The reader will be also referred to a book written by Dominique Labb{\'e} (hereafter DL) in 2003 (Labb{\'e}, 2003). In that book, DL recapitulates for a larger audience most of the contents of the paper.

  abstract = {Let xxx and yyy be two random variables with continuous cumulative distribution functions fff and ggg. A statistic UUU depending on the relative ranks of the xxx's and yyy's is proposed for testing the hypothesis f=gf=gf = g. Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis f=gf=gf = g the probability of obtaining a given UUU in a sample of nx${'}$snx${'}$sn x's and my${'}$smy${'}$sm y's is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving nnn and mmm. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of UUU for samples up to n=m=8n=m=8n = m = 8. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if m,nm,nm, n go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives f(x)$>$g(x)f(x)$>$g(x)f(x) $>$ g(x) for every xxx.},

This model has been applied to Racine's plays and can also be used to measure the increase of vocabulary with corpus size, to locate stylistic changes or to compare several texts from the point of view of their lexical rich},

It is argued that such studies are involved in an act of reification, in which, moreover, fundamental ingredients of the texts, e.g. their (highly important) range of figurative meanings, are eliminated from the analysis. Instead a concentration on lower levels of linguistic organization, such as grammar and lexis, may be observed, in spite of the fact that these are often the least relevant aspects of the text. In doing so, quantitative studies of literature significantly reduce not only the cultural value of texts, but also the generalizability of its own findings. What is needed, therefore, is an awareness and readiness to relate to matters of textuality as an organizing principle underlying the cultural functioning of literary works of art.},

The respective frequencies of the word-types can be arrayed hierarchically to form a frequency profile for each text. When a number of profiles are correlated with each other, the resulting matrix shows appropriate resemblances and differences across the range of texts. The whole pattern of interrelationships can then be `mapped', by applying eigen analysis to the correlation-matrix.
This form of analysis can be applied to comparisons of dialogue with narrative; of the idiolects of different characters; or \textemdash{} in the territory to which the present paper is addressed \textemdash{} of narrative with narrative. When several narratives are compared, authorial and chronological determinants predominate. When the segments of a single narrative are compared, even subtler stylistic determinants declare themselves and point towards the possibility of a computerassisted literary criticism.},

Unfortunately rare events do make up a large fraction of real text.However, more applicable methods based on likelihood ratio tests are available that yield good results with relatively small samples. These tests can be implemented efficiently, and have been used for the detection of composite terms and for the determination of domain-specific terms. In some cases, these measures perform much better than the methods previously used. In cases where traditional contingency table methods work well, the likelihood ratio tests described here are nearly identical.This paper describes the basis of a measure based on likelihood ratios that can be applied to the analysis of text.},

Our system outputs as well with a series of useful markers (syntactic tags, word boundaries, etc. ). This tool has been developed and tested on a corpus containing all P. Corneille`s and J. Racine's plays, totaling about 80,000 verses, and has proved to be almost error free on these data.

Special emphasis is put on the problems that faced the computational implementation of the aforementioned findings, as well as the selection of the most appropriate stylometrics (i.e., stylistic scores) to achieve better results on text categorization. This approach is language independent, empirically driven, and can be used in various applications including grammar and style checking, natural language generation, style verification in real world text, and recognition of style shift between adjacent portions of text.},

  doi = {10.1093/llc/14.4.467},
  abstract = {Assigning a date to a text is an important task in stylometry. Most previous research, however, have worked on intractable problems, where a true chronology will never be known with certainty, such as the works of Plato, Shakespeare or Marlowe. It is argued here that stylochronometric methods should be extensively tested on unproblematic texts before being used in disputed cases. As part of such testing, the present study applies a novel technique, Monte-Carlo Feature-Finding, to the verse of W. B. Yeats, where the dating is relatively well documented. Yeats insisted that his language changed as he grew older, and most readers would concur; yet scholars have not reached agreement on the nature of this linguistic change. A quasi-random search algorithm was used to find markers substrings in 142 poems of Yeats. To test their distinctiveness, four trials were performed: (1) assignment of ten poems absent from the training sample to their correct period; (2) detecting differences in two poems written by Yeats in his twenties and revised when he was fifty; (3) constructing a regression formula; and (4) classifying two prose extracts written forty-six years apart. Assigning short poems (median length 114 words) to their correct chronological period is a non-trivial task. Nevertheless, counting of distinctive substrings gave the right assignment in nine out of ten unseen cases. Moreover, these substring frequencies were sensitive enough to detect authorial revision in two early poems revised by Yeats many years after he originally wrote them, and robust enough to classify a pair of short prose extracts correctly; as well as accounting for 71\% of the variance when used in a regression to predict the year in which thirteen poems, absent from the training sample, were composed. These results suggest that short substrings found by a Monte-Carlo process warrant further investigation as stylistic indicators.},

  abstract = {A well-known problem in the domain of quantitative linguistics and stylistics concerns the evaluation of the lexical richness of texts. Since the most obvious measure of lexical richness, the vocabulary size (the number of different word types), depends heavily on the text length (measured in word tokens), a variety of alternative measures has been proposed which are claimed to be independent of the text length. This paper has a threefold aim. Firstly, we have investigated to what extent these alternative measures are truly textual constants. We have observed that in practice all measures vary substantially and systematically with the text length. We also show that in theory, only three of these measures are truly constant or nearly constant. Secondly, we have studied the extent to which these measures tap into different aspects of lexical structure. We have found that there are two main families of constants, one measuring lexical richness and one measuring lexical repetition. Thirdly, we have considered to what extent these measures can be used to investigate questions of textual similarity between and within authors. We propose to carry out such comparisons by means of the empirical trajectories of texts in the plane spanned by the dimensions of lexical richness and lexical repetition, and we provide a statistical technique for constructing confidence intervals around the empirical trajectories of texts. Our results suggest that the trajectories tap into a considerable amount of authorial structure without, however, guaranteeing that spatial separation implies a difference in authorship.},

The familiar debate concerning lemmatization of textual data may have lost virulence but still remains topical.
Comparison made between studies based on non-lemmatized data, which are still valuable and the more
sophisticated processing of normalized and tagged data, almost always confirms the results obtained from raw
data. However, access to lemma and to grammatical tags opens up new dimensions to research. Whether
considering phrase functions, parts of discourse, verbal tense, person or mood, the syntactical rather than the
lexical aspects will be considered, exploring a new version of the HYPERBASE tool and involving an
experimental corpus of 2 million tokens, including 26 texts and 13 authors.

We performed a number of experiments with texts from a German newspaper. With nearly perfect reliability the SVM was able to reject other authors and detected the target author in 60\textendash{}80\% of the cases. In a second experiment, we ignored nouns, verbs and adjectives and replaced them by grammatical tags and bigrams. This resulted in slightly reduced performance.

Design of new tools, it is argued, should give full space to how literary critics interact with texts, rather than simply focus on what computers can do well.

This article presents a survey of the current state of the art as well as a framework for uniform and unified development of a tool to apply the state of the art, despite the wide variety of methods and techniques used. The usefulness of the framework is confirmed by the development of a tool using that framework that can be applied to authorship analysis by researchers without a computing specialization. Using this tool, it may be possible both to expand the pool of available researchers as well as to enhance the quality of the overall solutions [for example, by incorporating improved algorithms as discovered through empirical analysis (Juola, P.

This study uses several such techniques to explore the traditional distinction between James's early and late styles. They confirm this distinction, identify an intermediate style, and facilitate an analysis of the lexical character of James's style. Especially revealing are techniques that identify words with extremely variable frequencies across James's oeuvre\textendash{}words that clearly characterize the various period styles. Such words disproportionately increase or decrease steadily throughout James's remarkably unidirectional stylistic development. Stylometric techniques constitute a promising avenue of research that exploits the power of corpus analysis and returns our attention to a manageable subset of an author's vocabulary.},

Advanced Access published January 12, 2010:10.1007/s10579-009-9111-2], for instance in social networks, will likely involve large sets of candidate authors and only limited data per author. In this article, we present the results of a systematic study of two important parameters in supervised machine learning that significantly affect performance in computational authorship attribution: (1) the number of candidate authors (i.e. the number of classes to be learned), and (2) the amount of training data available per candidate author (i.e. the size of the training data). We also investigate the robustness of different types of lexical and linguistic features to the effects of author set size and data size. The approach we take is an operationalization of the standard text categorization model, using memory-based learning for discriminating between the candidate authors. We performed authorship attribution experiments on a set of three benchmark corpora in which the influence of topic could be controlled. The short text fragments of e-mail length present the approach with a true challenge. Results show that, as expected, authorship attribution accuracy deteriorates as the number of candidate authors increases and size of training data decreases, although the machine learning approach continues performing significantly above chance. Some feature types (most notably character n-grams) are robust to changes in author set size and data size, but no robust individual features emerge.},

The ways people use words in their writing and in everyday life reflect people's social and psychological states. Whereas most text analysis research has focused on the content of people's writings, the current paper demonstrates that almost-invisible function words can be psychologically relevant as well. Through the analysis of pronouns, prepositions, and other function words used in literature, several studies demonstrate how authors' emotional states, aging processes, theories of mind, and the nature of their romantic and collaborative relationships are revealed through their words. The function word approach provides a glimpse of the rapidly expanding methods available to psychologists interested in tracking the social and psychological worlds of authors. With the upcoming release of data sets such as Google Books, the analysis of literature will likely serve as a foundational method used in the fields of psychology, linguistics, history, and other areas of the behavioral and social sciences.},

  abstract = {In this paper we examine the definitions of two widely-used interrelated constructs in corpus linguistics, keyness and keywords, as presented in the literature and corpus software manuals. In particular, we focus on 
a.	the consistency of definitions given in different sources; 
b.	the metrics used to calculate the level of keyness;
c.	the compatibility between definitions and metrics.

Our survey of studies employing keyword analysis has indicated that the vast majority of studies examine a subset of keywords \textendash{} almost always the top X number of keywords as ranked by the metric used. This renders the issue of the appropriate metric central to any study using keyword analysis. 

In this study, we first argue that an appropriate, and therefore useful, metric for keyness needs to be fully consistent with the definition of keyword. We then use four sets of comparisons between corpora of different types and sizes, in order to test whether and to what extent the use of different metrics affects the ranking of keywords. More precisely, we look at the extent of overlap in the keyword rankings resulting from the adoption of different metrics, and we discuss the implications of ranking-based analysis adopting one metric or another. Finally, we propose a new metric for keyness, and demonstrate a simple way to calculate the metric, which supplements the keyword extraction in existing corpus software.},

The task was to detect and distinguish four types\textemdash{}direct, free indirect, indirect, and reported ST\&WR\textemdash{}in a corpus of manually annotated German narrative texts. Rule-based as well as machine-learning methods were tested and compared. The results were best for recognizing direct ST\&WR (best F1 score: 0.87), followed by indirect (0.71), reported (0.58), and finally free indirect ST\&WR (0.40). The rule-based approach worked best for ST\&WR types with clear patterns, like indirect and marked direct ST\&WR, and often gave the most accurate results. Machine learning was most successful for types without clear indicators, like free indirect ST\&WR, and proved more stable. When looking at the percentage of ST\&WR in a text, the results of machine-learning methods always correlated best with the results of manual annotation. Creating a union or intersection of the results of the two approaches did not lead to striking improvements. A stricter definition of ST\&WR, which excluded borderline cases, made the task harder and led to worse results for both approaches.},
